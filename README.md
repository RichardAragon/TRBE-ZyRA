# 🔆 TRBE-ZyRA: Topological Resonant Beam Encoding for Symbolic Language Transmission

Welcome to **TRBE-ZyRA**, a cutting-edge symbolic communication framework that merges **topological photonic encoding** with **high-dimensional language embeddings**. This repository demonstrates a new frontier in **semantic multiplexing and beam-based communication**, where symbolic information is physically embedded into structured light fields for high-fidelity transmission and recovery.

> ✨ From **"Hello World"** to **multi-phrase symbolic multiplexing**, TRBE-ZyRA represents a foundational leap toward photonic language modeling and geometric neuro-symbolic systems.

## 📡 Project Overview

TRBE-ZyRA combines two powerful paradigms:

- **TRBE (Topological Resonant Beam Encoding)** — A spatial-harmonic encoding system based on Dirac mass modulation and structured light.
- **ZyRA Semantic Embeddings** — Symbolic vectors derived from models like **Word2Vec** and **Sentence-BERT**, mapped into beam geometry through **projection matrix encoding**.

This repo provides progressive examples from:
- Bit-level topological encoding of `"Hello World"`  
- Word embedding encoding/decoding  
- Sentence-level projection embedding  
- Semantic **multiplexing of 2 phrases (Left/Right beam halves)**  
- Full **2×2 multiplexed symbolic encoding** of **4 phrases in beam quadrants**  
- High-fidelity decoding with 0.997+ cosine similarity

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Dirac Mass Encoding** | Binary modulation of beam structure simulating JR domain transitions. |
| **Harmonic Resonance Layer** | Phase-skewed sinusoidal layers represent symbolic harmonics. |
| **Projection Matrix Encoding** | Semantic embeddings are spatialized across grid geometry. |
| **Pseudoinverse Decoding** | Semantic embeddings are recovered from beam structure. |
| **Cosine Similarity Validation** | Symbolic fidelity is evaluated through embedding similarity. |

## 💡 Example Phrases Encoded

- `"Hello World"`  
- `"Good Morning"`  
- `"How Are You"`  
- `"See You Later"`

Recovered via symbolic decoding from 2×2 beam multiplexing with >99.7% accuracy.
